# Arrow Chameleon96 by NovTech - Golden Hardware Reference Design

This project is a fleshed-out implementation of the GHDR (Golden Hardware Design Reference) demo for the Arrow Chameleon96 Community board by NovTech. The board itself is a breakout for an SoC consisting of an Intel Cyclone V FPGA and an ARM Cortex-A9 processor, which is configured to run Linux. 

The HDL files to configured the FPGA can be automatically generated using the Platform Designer tool (formerly known as Qsys) on Quartus Prime.

## Building the project

Quartus Prime has been used to build this system. It will produce a .sof file for programming the FPGA.
